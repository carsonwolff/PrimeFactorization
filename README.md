# PrimeFactorization
Hello, and welcome to my second coding project! This project was inspired by my interest in Cybersecurity and RSA encyption, which uses the product of primes to calculate a key:

If you would like to use my program download the .java files, then:

Navigate to the correct directory
Windows: In the terminal use dir and cd to navigate to the Downloads (usually done through typing "cd Downloads"), use dir to check that you are in the right place.
Mac OS: Use pwd, ls, and cd to Navigate to the Downloads, use ls to check.
Type "javac *enter file name*.java " to compile. Compile both files.
Type "java *enter file name*" to run. 

If you only want to check out the Prime number generator, which generates primes from 3 to n, you can just run that program. I wouldn't put in anything more than 9 digits unless you want to wait a while.

For the factorization, I had it generate the factors of a 17-digit number in a minute or so.
